# Taxi-Application-Version2

The goal of the project was to design a multi-threading GUI Java application simulating a taxi kiosk where workers allocate taxis to a list of waiting groups of people. Groups of passengers are in a queue and are waiting for a taxi until served by workers at   their respective windows. Everything happens simultaneously. The workers stop working when at least one of the queues is empty.
